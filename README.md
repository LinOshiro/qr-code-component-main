## Overview

Took about two hours to fully get page similar to mobile and full screen images. At first had a little trouble with positioning. Overall I feel good about the final product and I felt that the practice helps refine my skills.

## My process

1. Started with basic html
2. Checked styling details and looked over the images.
3. Started implementing basic CSS stylings
4. Used developer tools to figure out dimensions and styling.
5. Used media queries to match phone screen and full screen dimensions.
6. Added to Netlify.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Need to work on flexbox skills and the use of flex and position.

### Continued development

Eventually would like to upgrade to use figma and get better practice at looking at a layout and matching the stylings. Love that I was able to do this project quickly, it shows my growing understanding of html and css.
